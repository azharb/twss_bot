Using a naive bayes classifier for now since libsvm is a linux only gem/library and my ubuntu needs some more tinkering around. 

This naive bayes seems to classify at a naive level fine. Will need to create a solid sampling of negative text examples, probably from Reddit all comments. 

Link to library bayes library: https://github.com/bmuller/ankusa, I use MongoDb for storage.
